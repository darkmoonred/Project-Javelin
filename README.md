What is Project-Javelin?
- Submit your best matches in Halo Master Cheif Collection to our public leaderboard by entering your gamertag.

How does it work?
- Connects to the public custom built API here: https://autocode.com/stdlib/halo/mcc/
- Pings back latest match which is logged into a POSTGRESQL database (hosted for free!) on elephantsql
- Website is hosted for free on Heroku

What I learned:
- Fully understand and use Postgresql databases
- Deploy a full real-world application with Docker from start to finish
- Consume restful API data and save the data into a database
